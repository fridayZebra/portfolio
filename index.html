    <div class="about-me-text text">
      <p>Greetings! My name is Firoz ('fee-rose'). I am new to front end engineering, but I love it because it has a
        creative component as well as technological one. I plan to learn the backend as well, but want to enjoy the
        visual side for now. All my post college work experience has been in finance. I worked in client facing roles,
        operations, trading and most recently database administration.</p>

      <p>I love animals. I run a small doggie day care out of my house and board dogs on
        the weekend. I'd like to open an animal sanctuary for senior animals in years to come. If you want to give me
        acreage or money to help me do this, I won't say no. I also won't say no to pizza...unless it has pineapples on
        it.</p>
